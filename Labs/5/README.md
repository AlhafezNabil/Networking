 
## Binary Number System.
 
1. Binary and IPv4 Addresses:


2. Hexadecimal and IPv6 Addresses:Binary and hexadecimal work well together because it is easier to express a value as a single hexadecimal digit than as four binary bits.

The hexadecimal numbering system is used in networking to represent IP Version 6 addresses and Ethernet MAC addresses.

IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length and every 4 bits is represented by a single hexadecimal digit; for a total of 32 hexadecimal values. IPv6 addresses are not case-sensitive and can be written in either lowercase or uppercase.

As shown in the figure, the preferred format for writing an IPv6 address is x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x, with each “x” consisting of four hexadecimal values. When referring to 8 bits of an IPv4 address we use the term octet. In IPv6, a hextet is the unofficial term used to refer to a segment of 16 bits or four hexadecimal values. Each “x” is a single hextet, 16 bits, or four hexadecimal digits.

This graphic has a top line with the 8 hextets of the IPv6 address expressed as X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X. Beneath each X are the numbers 0000 representing the first number that can be in this field below each 0 is the to and below that are the lower case numbers ffff representing the maximum value that can be made in a single hextet. Under the X in the fourth hextet is an orange arrow pointing to the numbers 0000 to ffff, which are in a box. Under the box is another arrow point down to to a section of numbers. At the center of the arrow is the statement 4 hexadecimal digits = 16 binary digits. Under the arrow are a section of numbers with four parts. Each of the four parts has 0000 under that the word to under that the numbers 1111.
This is to represent the binary of each hexadecimal number, since each number is made of 4 binary digits and there are 4 hexadecimal digits in each hextet for a total of 16 bits.
